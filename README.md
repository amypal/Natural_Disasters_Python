### Exploring the frequency and type of natural disasters between 1970 and 2021 across the globe

Natural disasters seem to be occurring with more and more frequency, with devastating consequences. Using data sourced from Kaggle covering global natural disasters recorded between 1970 to 2021, I began searching for patterns in the occurance, type and location of natural disasters

Analysis conducted using Python
- Exploratory visual analysis
- Geospatial analysis
- Regression analysis 
- Cluster analysis
- Time-series analysis

Folder Contents
- Dataframes consisted of - Natural Disasters data from 1970 -2021 and Temperature Changes by country and month for the same timeframe
- Scripts contain code used to derive insights into natural disasters frequency, location and type using various techniques listed above
- Analysis folder contains html file created using geospatial analysis
